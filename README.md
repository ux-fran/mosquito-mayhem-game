# Welcome to the Mosquito Mayhem Game Jam Repository! 🎮🦟

🔙 _Back to my Blender projects main hub_: [Fran's Blender Projects Hub](https://github.com/ux-fran/blender-projects-main-hub-repo)

_Project Status_: **Finished** 🎉  
_Repository_: **[Mosquito Mayhem Game Jam Repository](https://github.com/ux-fran/mosquito-mayhem-repo)**  
_Project Progress_: **[Mosquito Mayhem Progress](https://github.com/users/ux-fran/projects/72/views/1)** 

This repository documents the creation of **Mosquito Mayhem**, my very first full game jam experience! Built during the [Pirate Software Game Jam 16](https://itch.io/jam/pirate16) in just two weeks, Mosquito Mayhem is a chaotic 2D pixel platformer where **you are the weapon**—a mutated mosquito using its stinger to survive and explode. I created all the art in Blender, imported it into Unity, and collaborated with my talented game dev friend, who handled all the coding. This was a dream come true!

## 🧩 Project Overview

- **Goal**: To participate in my first full game jam and create a complete game from scratch within two weeks.
- **Game Genre**: 2D pixel platformer with chaotic combat.
- **Theme**: "You Are the Weapon" – interpreted as a mosquito whose only weapon is its body.
- **Tools Used**: Blender (for pixel art and animations), Unity (for game development), itch.io (for publishing).

## 📚 Learning Goals

This project pushed me to explore new creative and technical areas:

1. **Blender for Pixel Art**: I used Blender in orthographic mode and rendered with Eevee to create pixel-style animations—a super fun process that I plan to refine further.
2. **Asset Workflow**: Created assets with simple flat materials and optimized exports to PNG sequences.
3. **Game Design Collaboration**: Worked closely with a friend to shape the game mechanics, vibe, and level design.
4. **Unity Workflow**: Gained experience preparing and importing assets into Unity.
5. **Scope & Focus**: Learned how to design around a simple mechanic and build a complete experience within a time constraint.

## 🎮 Side Quest: A Dream Come True

This game jam wasn't just a project; it was a **personal milestone**. Years ago, I had an idea for a platformer game but lacked the skills to bring it to life. After returning to Blender and rekindling my love for game dev, participating in this jam felt magical. For the first time, I had the tools, the vision, and the support to make it happen.

Curious about how I got here? I shared my full journey in this blog post:
